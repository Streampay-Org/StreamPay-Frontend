### Accessibility (a11y)

- [ ] All interactive elements (buttons, links, form controls, custom
      widgets) are reachable and operable via keyboard alone, with a visible
      focus indicator.
- [ ] Screen-reader support verified: no unlabelled regions, icon-only
      controls have accessible names, and dynamic content updates use an
      `aria-live` region where appropriate.

      is paired with any color-coded indicator).
- [ ] N/A — this change has no user-facing UI impact.

### Checklist

- [ ] No secrets or keys committed
- [ ] No PII or sensitive data in logs
- [ ] All security scans pass (or exemptions documented)
- [ ] Branch protection requirements met
- [ ] Code review from security team (for critical changes)
