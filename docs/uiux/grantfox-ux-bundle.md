# GrantFox UX Bundle

This document covers the GrantFox UI updates bundled on a single branch:

- `#531` push-notification opt-in UX with email fallback
- `#543` accessible cancel or withdraw confirmation modal
- `#551` timestamp tooltips with relative and ISO timestamps
- `#558` onboarding explainer for new users
- `#861` mobile bottom nav with unread badges

## API Notes

No backend API contract changes were required for this bundle.

- `PushOptIn` only requests browser notification permission in secure, supported contexts.
- `ConfirmCancel` sends the existing stream action plus a client-side `amount` display label for confirmation UX only.
- `Timestamp` is presentation-only and does not alter payload shapes.
- `Explainer` is static onboarding content.
- `BottomNav` / `AppBottomNav` are client-only navigation components; badge counts are passed via props.

If server persistence is later added for push subscriptions or fallback preferences, or if unread counts are fetched from an API, that should be documented in `openapi.json` and the relevant API route README before release.

## Components Added

- `app/components/PushOptIn.tsx`
- `app/components/ConfirmCancel.tsx`
- `app/components/Timestamp.tsx`
- `app/components/Explainer.tsx`

## Routes Added or Updated

- `app/settings/notifications/page.tsx`
- `app/settings/page.tsx`
- `app/streams/[id]/page.tsx`
- `app/streams/[id]/StreamDetailClient.tsx`
- `app/streams/StreamsPageContent.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`

The streams empty state now uses a more guided first-time layout with clearer next steps and a stronger call to action for new users.

## Verification

Standard domain verification for this bundle:

- `npm test`
- `npm run lint`
