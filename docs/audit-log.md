# Immutable Audit Log for Privileged and Financial Actions

StreamPay now records a tamper-evident, append-only audit record for privileged stream operations that can move money or bypass normal flow controls.

## Covered actions

- `stream.stop.override`
- `stream.settle`
- `stream.withdraw`

Each entry records:

- actor id and role
- target stream id and account label
- action name
- before/after hashes and a diff hash
- timestamp
- request id
- previous-entry hash and current-entry hash

## Retention

- Default retention: **30 days**
- Expired entries are archived to cold storage by the daily retention job before they are removed from the active append-only store.
- The API returns `retentionDays` for JSON reads and `x-audit-retention-days`
  for NDJSON exports.
- The store exposes `archiveExpiredEntries()` and `restoreArchivedEntries()` so
  archived records can be restored without changing the existing hash-chain
  values.
- Retention cleanup is performed with the admin CLI, not through the public API:

```bash
# Dry-run rows older than the retention window
npx ts-node scripts/purge-audit.ts --older-than-days 2555

# Execute the purge after reviewing the dry-run output
npx ts-node scripts/purge-audit.ts --older-than-days 2555 --execute
```

The CLI prints a JSON result containing the cutoff timestamp, purge count,
retained count, request id, and before/after hash-chain integrity flags.
Use `--help` to view the supported arguments, `--older-than-days` to choose
the retention threshold, and `--execute` to perform the purge after a dry-run
review. The parser trims whitespace around numeric and request-id values so
operator inputs are handled consistently.

## Access matrix

| Role | Read `/api/audit` | Export `?export=ndjson` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `support` | Yes | No |
| `finance` | Yes | No |
| `admin` | Yes | Yes |
| `security` | Yes | Yes |
| `compliance` | Yes | Yes |
| `user` | No | No |

## Export redaction

Incident-response exports redact target account labels to a masked form such as `acct***demo`.

- Included: actor id, actor role, target stream id, redacted account, action, request id, timestamp, hash chain
- Excluded from export: raw before/after payloads and unredacted target account labels

This keeps exports useful for investigations without leaking unnecessary PII into shared files.

```

## Notes and intentional exclusions

- The current implementation uses an in-memory append-only store because this repo is a frontend/mock API surface. A production deployment should mirror each write to an external immutable sink such as S3 object lock or a warehouse table with write-once controls.
- No API exists to mutate or delete audit records. Retention purges are limited
  to the admin CLI and should only run after archived records have crossed the
  configured retention window.
- Search is available by actor id, role, action, target id, request id, and free-text query.
