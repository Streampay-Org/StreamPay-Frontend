/**
 * indexerStatus.ts
 *
 * Deterministic indexer status state machine.
 *
 * The Horizon indexer is long-running and can silently fall behind the chain
 * tip. To make normal operation and adverse conditions reviewable, the indexer
 * status is derived from a small set of telemetry inputs through a *pure, total,
 * deterministic* transition function. There is exactly one transition rule per
 * state and the rules are evaluated in a fixed, documented priority order, so
 * the same telemetry always yields the same status — even under retries,
 * partial failures, and cursor stall boundaries.
 *
 * ## State model
 *
 * ```
 * loading   cursor has never advanced (first poll in flight)
 * synced    running and advancing, lag within tolerance
 * syncing   running and advancing, but lag above tolerance
 * stalled   running but the cursor has not advanced within stallThresholdMs
 * stopped   main loop is not running, or the breaker is open (permission)
 * error     last failure is fatal / unrecoverable
 * retrying  last attempt failed but a backoff retry is scheduled (recoverable)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Transition priority (highest wins)
 *
 * 1. `breakerOpen`            → `stopped`  (permission: ingestion is suspended)
 * 2. `!running`               → `stopped`
 * 3. `failure === "fatal"`    → `error`    (diagnosability before staleness)
 * 4. `failure === "retrying"` → `retrying` (recoverable backoff)
 * 5. stale (cursor stagnant)  → `stalled`  (explicit stale-state transition)
 * 6. never advanced           → `loading`
 * 7. within lag tolerance     → `synced`   (else `syncing`)
 *
 * ## Invariants
 *
 * - `deriveIndexerStatus` is pure: it never mutates state, reads the clock, or
 *   throws. All time values are supplied by the caller (`now`), making the
 *   result reproducible in tests.
 * - While `running && !breakerOpen`, a cursor that has not advanced past the
 *   stall threshold **must** report `stalled` and can never silently report
 *   `synced` / `syncing`. `isStale` is the single source of truth for that
 *   transition and is exposed independently for callers that only need the
 *   predicate (e.g. logging or alerting).
 * - `isStale` uses a strictly-greater-than comparison against the threshold, so
 *   the boundary `now - lastProcessedAt === stallThresholdMs` is NOT yet stale.
 *   A zero or negative threshold disables staleness detection (never stale).
 * - Input validation is explicit and safe: unknown `failure` values, negative
 *   lag, and negative timestamps are normalized to well-defined defaults rather
 *   than producing inconsistent states.
